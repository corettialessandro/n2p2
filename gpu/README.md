# GPU port work

Code for the `nnp-train` GPU port described in `../GPU_PORTING_PLAN.md`. Kept
separate from `src/` so it doesn't touch the shared, upstream-tracked build
tree until it's ready to be integrated (see the plan's Phase 6).

## `smoke/`

Standalone CUDA smoke tests: from-scratch reimplementations of individual
n2p2 compute kernels (not linked against `libnnp`), each validated against
the exact same math read out of the corresponding CPU source file. Used to
prove out the CUDA toolchain and each kernel's numerics in isolation before
any integration work.

Symmetry function coverage: **all 11 of n2p2's leaf types** in
`src/libnnp/SymFnc*.cpp` are ported and validated:

| Type | Status |
|---|---|
| `SymFncExpRad` (2) | done |
| `SymFncExpRadWeighted` (12) | done |
| `SymFncCompRad` (20) | done |
| `SymFncCompRadWeighted` (23) | done |
| `SymFncExpAngn` (3) | done |
| `SymFncExpAngnWeighted` (13) | done |
| `SymFncExpAngw` (9) | done |
| `SymFncCompAngn` (21) | done |
| `SymFncCompAngnWeighted` (24) | done |
| `SymFncCompAngw` (22) | done |
| `SymFncCompAngwWeighted` (25) | done |

- `symfnc_exprad_test.cu` — the original ExpRad-only smoke test (one CUDA
  thread per atom), kept as a synthetic-system regression check (`./
  symfnc_exprad_test`, no arguments). Superseded for real-data validation by
  `symfnc_family_test.cu`.
- `symfnc_family_test.cu` — all 11 types, one CUDA thread per selected
  central atom, all validated against real `H2O_2G` neighbor geometry
  (`./symfnc_family_test real_neighbors_full.txt`). `SymFncExpRad`/
  `SymFncExpAngn` use real production parameters straight out of
  `temp/H2O_2G/input.nn`; the other 9 types use representative parameters on
  the same real geometry, since that input.nn doesn't define instances of
  them. Validates the unscaled energy accumulator and the central atom's own
  derivative only (see the file's header comment for the exact scope,
  consistent with `symfnc_exprad_test.cu`). Two mathematically distinct
  angular parameterizations are both covered: the classic
  `(1+lambda*cos theta)^zeta` form (Exp-angular family) and a `CompactFunction`
  applied directly to `acos(cos theta)` — compact support in angle-space
  (Compact-angular family). For the latter's `*Weighted` variants, the
  atomic-number weight is folded into the angular part (`ang`/`dang`) rather
  than the radial part, unlike the Exp-angular weighted variants (which fold
  it into the exponential) — worth double-checking against
  `SymFncCompAngnWeighted.cpp` if this code is ever touched, since it's easy
  to misplace which factor the weight multiplies.
- `dump_real_neighbors.cpp` — one-off diagnostic linked against the already
  -built `lib/libnnp.a`, using n2p2's own `ElementMap`/`Structure` classes
  (not a reimplementation) to load `temp/H2O_2G/input.data` and dump every
  atom's complete, unfiltered neighbor list (element, distance, displacement
  vector) from the real `Structure::calculateNeighborList()`. One dump feeds
  every symmetry function type's test — each applies its own element-
  selection rule (or none, for the `*Weighted` variants) exactly like the
  corresponding `SymFnc::calculate()` does.
- `run.slurm` — builds the dumper and both CUDA tests and runs them in
  sequence on a Booster A100 (`sbatch gpu/smoke/run.slurm`). No GSL/BLAS
  linking needed for the dumper (confirmed `libnnp.a` has no undefined
  `gsl_*` symbols for this usage) — convenient, since the system linker
  can't parse `libgsl.so`'s compressed debug sections anyway.
